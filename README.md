ElderEase – AI-Powered Elderly Healthcare & Safety Assistant
Project Overview

ElderEase is a scalable AI-driven healthcare monitoring system designed to enhance elderly safety through real-time health tracking, fall detection, and emergency response mechanisms. The system integrates wearable sensor simulation, backend processing, and a caregiver dashboard to create a unified elderly-care ecosystem.

The project addresses the lack of integrated platforms that combine continuous health monitoring, anomaly detection, and emergency communication within a single intelligent framework.

Problem Statement

Elderly individuals often lack access to a unified monitoring system that provides continuous health tracking, fall detection, and emergency alert mechanisms. Existing solutions focus primarily on fitness tracking and do not provide predictive analytics or caregiver integration.

ElderEase aims to bridge this gap by designing a comprehensive AI-powered elderly healthcare assistant.
